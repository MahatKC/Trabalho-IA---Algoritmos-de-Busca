# Trabalho-IA---Algoritmos-de-Busca

Project developed by  [@MahatKC](https://www.github.com/MahatKC) and [@EnergyFall266](https://github.com/EnergyFall266) in 2021.

This project was an assignment for the Artificial Intelligence class we took in our 3th year of Computer Science.

It creates a tree based on heuristics and searchs it for the solutions to the 8 Queens problem.
